# The primary goal is to get a working rating system, even if it's not a perfect Glicko-2.

# Let's restart the Glicko-2 implementation with a focus on simplicity and getting it to run.
# I will remove the complex sigma update and use a fixed sigma for now.
# And ensure separate batting/bowling ratings.
